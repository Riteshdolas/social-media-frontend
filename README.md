## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself with a full-stack app that replicates real-world features like auth, file upload, user feeds, and protected routes.  
This taught me how to structure reusable components, work with JWT-based authentication, and manage global state with Context API.

The biggest challenge was building a scalable API and syncing frontend state with backend data in real time.
